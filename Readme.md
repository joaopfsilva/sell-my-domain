# Express.js Domain Landing Page Generator

## Goal/Motivation

The goal of this project is to provide a **quick and simple solution** for generating a landing page to inform users that a domain is for sale. This script allows you to create a basic webpage where potential buyers can see that the domain is available and contact you via email. The entire process is automated to streamline the deployment to Fly.io and the uploading of the code to GitHub.

If you want to make the landing page available under the domain itself (which is recommended), you simply need to configure your domain's DNS to point to the Fly.io application.
